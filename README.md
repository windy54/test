This is "simple" project to control neopixels on a  fishtank, it switches white leds on in the daytime and then blue at night.
Brightness can be set for white and blue leds.
Simple web interface is used to set data, ESP connects to a configured hotspot, if this is not available it creates an access point

This version uses two leds rather than neopixels.
